# Codex Connect

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dsh-codex-connect/alpha?label=npm%20alpha&color=cb3837)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dsh-codex-connect)

English | [中文](docs/README.zh.md)

Connect your ChatGPT subscription to DeepSeek Harness with OAuth, optional GPT Image generation, user-controlled defaults, Harness-native approvals, diagnostics, and reliable session recovery.

Community Alpha — not affiliated with or endorsed by OpenAI, ChatGPT, Codex, DeepSeek, or DeepSeek Harness.

Codex Connect adds the `openai-codex` model provider to the normal Harness agent loop. Harness continues to manage tools, permissions, approvals, attachments, session persistence, compaction, and recovery. Installing the plugin does not change your default model or search route, and it does not turn a ChatGPT subscription into an OpenAI Platform API key.

This fork's `main` branch targets the dedicated Plugins page in DeepSeek Harness `0.1.6-alpha.2`; its live-host compatibility is being verified separately. The published npm Alpha and compatibility table below describe the upstream release, not this fork.

## Quick start

This guide describes the published pairings below. Check `dsh --version` first and use `doctor --json` to inspect the installed model-runtime packages: an rc.1 CLI can resolve rc.2 packages. For other versions, use [Installation and upgrades](INSTALL.md). A moving npm tag such as `alpha` is not a compatibility guarantee.

| Requirement | Verified pairing |
|---|---|
| Codex Connect | `0.1.0-alpha.4.39` |
| DeepSeek Harness | `0.1.2-rc.1`, `0.1.5-alpha.1`, `0.1.5-rc.1`, or `0.1.5-rc.2` |
| Node.js | `^22.19.0 \|\| >=24.0.0` |
| Account | ChatGPT OAuth with access to the requested Codex model; availability is decided by OpenAI |

As of 2026-09-21, npm `alpha` points to 4.39 while `latest` intentionally remains on 4.34. Use the exact version below for 4.39; this recommendation does not promote the default installation channel.

### 1. Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-codex-connect@0.1.0-alpha.4.39
dsh web
```

Replace `web` with your existing profile name; use that same profile when starting Harness. From a DSH source checkout, prefix commands with `pnpm`. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for other profiles and installation checks.

### 2. Authorize and select a model

Open **Settings → Models → Openai-Codex → Authorize**, then complete approval yourself in the browser. If an embedded window is blocked, select **Open ChatGPT sign-in page**. Choose an `openai-codex` model in the normal Harness model picker.

Never paste an authorization URL, code, token, or account identifier into an issue, log, chat, or configuration file. For a browser on another device, the optional manual callback form can complete the pending login without forwarding the localhost callback port; follow [Remote browser authorization](docs/reference.md#remote-browser-authorization).

### 3. Check the installation

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web exec dsh-codex-connect status --json
dsh plugin --profile web exec dsh-codex-connect doctor --json
```

`status --json` exits `0` when signed in and `1` when signed out, without starting OAuth. `doctor --json` reports local installation diagnostics without a network request or raw credentials. A passing diagnostic is not proof of model access; verify that with an actual request.

## Core capabilities

- **Accounts:** save up to 16 accounts on the DSH host and manually select the active account for subsequent requests. Account selection is not a per-session binding. Requests keep their captured account; the plugin does not rotate accounts or silently fail over.
- **Models and Astra support:** the currently verified DSH and plugin combination supports `gpt-6-astra`. The plugin supplies its missing model definition with Low, Medium, High, Xhigh, and Max reasoning levels; Default preserves the provider default. Saved Off/Minimal selections require an [explicit update](MIGRATION.md#astra-reasoning-selections). When the installed dependency catalog includes Astra, the plugin preserves its native metadata while retaining these five calibrated reasoning choices. A model appearing in the list does not mean the current account has permission to use it; overall compatibility with new dependency versions still requires separate verification.
- **Fast Mode:** request priority service for one conversation, off by default. Actual speed and quota consumption depend on the service; no fixed speed multiplier is guaranteed.
- **Quota:** show the server-returned `5h` and `7d` windows and reset times, normally refreshed every 60 seconds while signed in and the tab is visible; failures back off. Missing windows are not invented; Spark uses its separate quota bucket.
- **Plugin updates:** check for newer Codex Connect releases without installing anything or recommending changes to DSH. Host compatibility is available through explicit local diagnostics.

## Optional capabilities

All options below are off on a fresh installation. Edit them in **Plugins → Codex Connect → More settings** or **Settings → Models → Openai-Codex → More settings**, then select **Save changes**. A conflict or failed save preserves your draft.

| Capability | Enable with | Important behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Proxy | `enableProxy` | Credential-free HTTP(S), scoped to this plugin's traffic. A failed proxy request does not silently retry directly. |
| Codex Search | `enableSearch` | Selects Codex for the entire profile's search route; disabling restores the previously active route. |
| Luna Reserve | `enableReserveFallback` | Uses the hidden Reserve route only when the backend explicitly authorizes it for the captured account; never changes global defaults or retries a generic `429`. |
| Image viewing | `enableImageTool` | Adds `view_image` to vision-capable models for local files and validated public HTTP(S) images. |
| GPT Image generation | `enableImageGeneration` | Prompt-only generation; availability, dimensions, and quota remain account- and service-controlled. |
| Auto-review | `enableAutoReview` | Sends bounded approval context, tool arguments, working directory, and the planned action to `chatgpt.com`, with confirmation on first enablement. Failures return to human approval. |

**Published experiment:** Alpha 4.35 includes Luna Reserve fallback, disabled by default. Real-account Reserve entry and recovery remain unverified; Alpha 4.34 does not include this feature.

With `enableReserveFallback: true`, the account UI and agent routing share one identity-bound quota state. Background refresh follows the returned quota windows while recently in use; fresh state is reused across agent steps. Ordinary quota reads also share the cache, even with Reserve disabled. The plugin enters `gpt-reserve` only with complete, non-FedRAMP account/user identity and backend Luna Reserve authorization, then restores the session's previous model and reasoning effort after confirmed ordinary-usage recovery. Reserve has its own allowance, is hidden from the model picker, and is not unlimited. The backend decides eligibility; reset times alone do not authorize a switch. This version supports known `gpt-5.6-luna` metadata only. See [Luna Reserve fallback](docs/reference.md#luna-reserve-fallback) for refresh, identity, and verification limits.

Use the image generation capability included with your current GPT subscription. Generated originals are stored separately from attachment previews; disabling the capability or uninstalling the plugin does not delete them. See [Configuration and recovery](docs/reference.md#search-and-image-tools) for storage and access rules.

Auto-review operates after Harness policy requires approval; it does not bypass that policy. See [Auto-review behavior](docs/auto-review.md) before enabling it.

## FAQ and important limits

### Where are my credentials stored?

OAuth credentials are stored on the host running DSH and used there to authenticate and send requests to OpenAI. Normal browser account responses return account summaries, not raw tokens. A remote browser device is not necessarily the DSH host.

### Does uninstalling sign me out?

No. OAuth state is stored separately at `$DSH_HOME/.openai-codex-auth.json` (`~/.dsh` by default). The plugin does not copy or modify `~/.codex/auth.json`. Use **Sign out all accounts**, or `logout` before uninstalling, only when deleting credentials is intentional.

### Can I switch accounts for different conversations?

Subsequent Codex requests use the selected active account; conversations do not bind their own accounts. Fast Mode is conversation-scoped. Cancelling a new authorization preserves existing accounts; an explicit revoked-refresh response asks for reauthorization, while temporary failures preserve the account for retry. See [Account behavior](docs/reference.md#accounts-models-and-quota).

### Why does a listed model fail?

Model HTTP/SSE failures include bounded, request-local diagnostic metadata after the existing error message. An `overloaded` message alone does not establish an account block. See [persistent-error diagnostics](docs/experiments/issue-219-diagnostics.md) for scope and reproduction.

Account permissions, plugin/host compatibility, and network conditions all affect availability. Access on another client does not guarantee this integration will work. OpenAI controls model access, quota, context capacity, and service behavior; catalog entries are not proof of entitlement.

### Does changing client headers prevent persistent authorization failures?

No such guarantee is established. Codex Connect is a third-party integration; it does not impersonate Codex Desktop or fabricate installation/attestation headers. The pi-ai model/OAuth route and auxiliary routes currently identify themselves differently. OpenAI's [App Server documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/app-server/) asks integrations to identify their own client with `clientInfo`; it does not establish acceptance rules for this plugin's direct backend calls. An `overloaded` message is not proof of a block. Capture the bounded error metadata and compare successful and failed windows before attributing the cause; share request IDs privately, never tokens or full session archives.

### Can I keep the original `dsh-codex` plugin installed?

Not in the same effective configuration: both register `openai-codex`. Follow [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md); remove only the confirmed conflicting entry, not credentials or unrelated providers.

### What do diagnostics prove?

`doctor` is local. Capability and reviewer probes may make network requests and consume quota when their preconditions are met. `auto-review-probe` checks only the reviewer route and structured response, not the full Harness approval integration or execution of the reviewed action. Commands, limits, and exit codes are in the [diagnostics reference](docs/reference.md#capability-probes).

A missing entry in [verified-compatibility.json](verified-compatibility.json) means a DSH/plugin combination is unverified, not known to be broken. Do not infer support for newer hosts from an older pairing.

```

`check` covers static checks, unit tests, build, compatibility, and packaging. `lint:metadata` checks package and release rules; `lint:source` checks host and browser TypeScript for unhandled or misused promises, invalid awaits, duplicate cases, and unreachable code. Browser regression and isolated DSH installation are separate commands. These checks use no real OAuth authorization and do not replace real-account acceptance.
